# vim404 : Art404's Vim Distribution

vim404 is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, Gvim and [MacVim]. Obviously a fork of spf13-vim.

# Installation

## Requirements
To make all the plugins work, specifically [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim), you need [vim with lua](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim#requirements).

## Linux, \*nix, Mac OSX Installation

The easiest way to install spf13-vim is to use our [automatic installer](https://j.mp/spf13-vim3) by simply copying and pasting the following line into a terminal. This will install spf13-vim and backup your existing vim configuration. If you are upgrading from a prior version (before 3.0) this is also the recommended installation.

*Requires Git 1.7+ and Vim 7.3+*

```bash

    curl https://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L > vim404.sh 
    sh spf13-vim.sh
```

If you have a bash-compatible shell you can run the script directly:
```bash

    sh <(curl https://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L)
```

### Installing dependencies

#### Install [Vim]

After the installation of Vim you must add a new directory to your environment variables path to make it work with the script installation of spf13.

Open Vim and write the following command, it will show the installed directory:

    :echo $VIMRUNTIME
    C:\Program Files (X86)\Vim\vim74

Then you need to add it to your environment variable path. After that try execute `vim` within command prompt (press Win-R, type `cmd`, press Enter) and youâ€™ll see the default vim page.

## Adding new plugins

Create `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` for any additional bundles.

To add a new bundle, just add one line for each bundle you want to install. The line should start with the word "Bundle" followed by a string of either the vim.org project name or the githubusername/githubprojectname. For example, the github project [spf13/vim-colors](https://github.com/spf13/vim-colors) can be added with the following command

```bash
    echo Bundle \'spf13/vim-colors\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
```

Once new plugins are added, they have to be installed.

```bash
    vim +BundleInstall! +BundleClean +q
```

## Removing (disabling) an included plugin

Create `~/.vimrc.local` if it doesn't already exist.

Add the UnBundle command to this line. It takes the same input as the Bundle line, so simply copy the line you want to disable and add 'Un' to the beginning.

For example, disabling the 'AutoClose' and 'scrooloose/syntastic' plugins

```bash
    echo UnBundle \'AutoClose\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
    echo UnBundle \'scrooloose/syntastic\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
```

**Remember to run ':BundleClean!' after this to remove the existing directories**
